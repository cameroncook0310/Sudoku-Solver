# Sudoku-Solver
## Project Overview
This project is a solver for the classic puzzle game Sudoku. I made it using Python and the GUI package tkinter. This project was a really interesting challenge for me since it was my first time working with Tkinter. 
## Instalation and running the solver 
To run the solver all you have to do is download the SudokuSolver.py file and the run it. From there just enter in the starting numbers for the puzzle you want to solve and press the solve button. As long you've input a legal puzzle, the solver should fill in the rest of the board with the solution!
